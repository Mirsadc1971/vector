# Google Search Console - Remove WWW Version

## The Issue
Google is indexing https://www.manage369.com/ separately even though it redirects to https://manage369.com/

## Immediate Actions Required in Google Search Console:

### 1. Add WWW Property to Search Console
1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click "Add property"
3. Choose "URL prefix" method
4. Enter: https://www.manage369.com
5. Verify using "HTML tag" method (same as main site)

### 2. Submit Removal Request
1. In Search Console, select www.manage369.com property
2. Go to "Removals" in left sidebar
3. Click "New Request"
4. Select "Remove all URLs with this prefix"
5. Enter: https://www.manage369.com/
6. Choose reason: "Duplicate, Google selected different canonical than user"
7. Submit request

### 3. Use URL Inspection Tool
1. Stay in www property
2. Go to "URL Inspection"
3. Enter: https://www.manage369.com/
4. You should see it redirects to https://manage369.com/
5. This confirms redirect is working

### 4. Link Both Properties
1. Go to Settings in main property (manage369.com)
2. Look for "Associate properties"
3. Link www and non-www versions

### 5. Update Your Canonical Tags (Already Done)
All pages have: <link rel="canonical" href="https://manage369.com/...">

## What's Already Fixed:
✅ 301 redirect from www to non-www (confirmed working)
✅ Canonical tags point to non-www version
✅ Sitemap only lists non-www URLs
✅ Robots.txt references non-www sitemap
✅ Both _redirects and netlify.toml have redirect rules

## Expected Timeline:
- Removal request: 24-48 hours
- Full de-indexing: 1-2 weeks
- Complete cleanup: 2-4 weeks

## To Monitor Progress:
1. Check "Coverage" report in both properties
2. Watch "Removals" status
3. Search Google for: site:www.manage369.com
   (Should show no results after removal)
