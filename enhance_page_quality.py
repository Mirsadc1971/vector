            <h2>Understanding HO6 Condo Insurance Requirements</h2>
            <p>HO6 insurance, also known as condo insurance or walls-in coverage, is essential protection for condominium owners. This policy covers your personal property, interior walls, floors, ceilings, and personal liability. Most associations require proof of adequate HO6 coverage to protect both individual owners and the community.</p>
            
            <h3>What Does HO6 Insurance Cover?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Property:</strong> Furniture, electronics, clothing, and other belongings</li>
                <li><strong>Interior Structures:</strong> Improvements, betterments, and additions to your unit</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Use:</strong> Additional living expenses if your unit becomes uninhabitable</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Liability:</strong> Protection if someone is injured in your unit</li>
                <li><strong>Loss Assessment:</strong> Your share of damages to common areas</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Minimum Coverage Requirements</h3>
            <p>While requirements vary by association, typical minimums include $300,000 in personal liability coverage, $10,000 in medical payments to others, and loss assessment coverage matching your association&#39;s deductible. Many associations also require coverage for improvements and betterments based on your unit&#39;s specific features. Contact our office for your association&#39;s specific requirements.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Annual Verification Matters</h3>
            <p>Regular insurance verification protects the entire community by ensuring all owners maintain adequate coverage. This helps prevent financial disputes following incidents, ensures compliance with mortgage requirements, and may qualify the association for better master policy rates. Submit your updated HO6 insurance information annually or whenever you change carriers.</p>

            <h2>Maintenance & Repair Request Process</h2>
            <p>Manage369 provides comprehensive maintenance coordination for all association properties. Our established vendor network and systematic approach ensures timely, cost-effective repairs while maintaining the highest quality standards. Submit requests online 24/7 for fastest response.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Area vs. Unit Repairs</h3>
            <p>Understanding responsibility for repairs is crucial. Generally, the association maintains common areas including hallways, lobbies, roofs, exterior walls, and shared systems. Unit owners are responsible for everything within their unit, including appliances, fixtures, and interior surfaces. Our team can clarify specific responsibilities based on your association&#39;s declarations.</p>
            
            <h3>Emergency Repair Response</h3>
            <p>We maintain 24/7 emergency response for critical issues including water leaks, electrical hazards, HVAC failures in common areas, security concerns, and elevator malfunctions. Our emergency hotline connects you directly with on-call personnel who can dispatch appropriate vendors immediately. For non-emergency repairs, we typically respond within 24 hours and schedule service within 48-72 hours.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Vendor Network</h3>
            <p>All Manage369 vendors are licensed, insured, and thoroughly vetted. We maintain relationships with specialists in plumbing, electrical, HVAC, roofing, concrete, landscaping, and general maintenance. Our volume purchasing power often results in cost savings of 15-20% compared to individual service calls. We guarantee all work and handle any follow-up issues promptly.</p>

            <h2>Resident Information & Registration</h2>
            <p>Maintaining accurate resident information is essential for effective property management, emergency response, and community communication. This secure form allows both owners and tenants to update contact details, emergency information, and occupancy status. All information is kept strictly confidential and used only for association business.</p>
            
            <h3>Why We Need Current Information</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Owner vs. Tenant Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Property owners remain ultimately responsible for their units, even when rented. Owners must provide current tenant information, ensure tenants receive and follow association rules, and remain liable for any violations or damages. Tenants should update their contact information directly and report maintenance issues promptly. Both owners and tenants can use this form to maintain current records.</p>
            
            <h3>Privacy & Security</h3>
            <p>Manage369 takes data security seriously. All resident information is stored in encrypted, secure databases with restricted access. We never share personal information with third parties except as required by law or emergency response. Information is retained only as long as necessary for property management purposes and destroyed securely when no longer needed.</p>
