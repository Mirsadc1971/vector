<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Q: Can a board make decisions without a meeting under the Illinois Condominium Property Act?</h3>
<p>A: No, except for emergency situations specifically defined in the Act. All board decisions must be made at properly noticed meetings where owners have the right to observe the decision-making process. Email votes or informal decisions are not valid.</p>
<h3>Q: What percentage of owners can call a special meeting?</h3>
<p>A: Under Section 18.1, owners holding 20% of the votes can petition for a special meeting. The board must call the meeting within 30 days of receiving a valid petition with proper signatures and stated purpose.</p>
<h3>Q: Are condominium boards required to have reserve funds?</h3>
<p>A: Yes, Section 9(c) requires associations to budget for "reasonable reserves" for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance. Generally, this means at least 10% of the budget, though owners can vote to waive this requirement annually.</p>
<h3>Q: Can unit owners sue board members individually?</h3>
<p>A: Board members are generally protected by the business judgment rule when acting in good faith within their authority. However, they can be held personally liable for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or actions outside their authority. D&amp;O insurance provides additional protection.</p>
<h3>Q: How long must associations keep records?</h3>
<p>A: The Act requires maintaining financial records for at least 7 years. Meeting minutes, contracts, and correspondence should also be kept for 7 years. Permanent records include the declaration, bylaws, and amendments.</p>
<h3>Q: Can associations restrict rentals?</h3>
<p>A: Yes, if authorized by the declaration. Associations can impose reasonable rental restrictions including minimum lease terms, tenant screening requirements, and caps on the percentage of rental units, subject to fair housing laws.</p>
