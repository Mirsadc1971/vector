# Urgent: Remove Spam URLs from Google Index

## Spam URLs Still in Google (as of Aug 23, 2025):
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=aps3e-github-release
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=rebahin-ana
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=rebahinxxi-casino
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=super777
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=aplikasi-er777
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=188bet-bonus
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=apk-aa666
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=apk-slot-ri
- https://manage369.com/tinggi/?wow=isnahamzah
- https://manage369.com/glencoe (missing /property-management/ path)

## Current Status:
✅ All /tinggi/ URLs return 404 (blocking is working)
❌ Google hasn't removed them from index yet

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### 1. Google Search Console - Bulk Removal (FASTEST)
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Select your property
3. Click **"Removals"** in left sidebar
4. Click **"New Request"**
5. Choose **"Remove all URLs with this prefix"**
6. Enter: `https://manage369.com/tinggi/`
7. Submit request

### 2. Individual URL Removal (For Stubborn URLs)
For each URL still showing:
1. Go to "Removals"
2. Click "New Request"
3. Select "Temporarily remove URL"
4. Paste the exact spam URL
5. Choose "Remove this URL only"
6. Submit

### 3. Update robots.txt to Block Spam
Add these lines to your robots.txt:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /tinggi/
Disallow: /*?wow=
Disallow: /*?*wow=
Disallow: /*?*apk*
Disallow: /*?*casino*
Disallow: /*?*slot*
Disallow: /*?*bet*
```

### 4. Fix the /glencoe URL
The URL https://manage369.com/glencoe is wrong. It should be:
- Correct: https://manage369.com/property-management/glencoe/
- Add redirect: /glencoe → /property-management/glencoe/

## Timeline for Removal:
- **With Removal Request**: 24-48 hours
- **Without Action**: 2-4 weeks (waiting for Google to recrawl)

## To Monitor Progress:
1. Search Google for: `site:manage369.com/tinggi/`
2. Should show "no results found" after removal
3. Check "Removals" tab in Search Console for status

## Why These Appeared:
These are spam/hack URLs that were likely created by:
- Previous security breach
- SEO spam attack
- Compromised plugin/form

## Prevention:
Your current setup blocks these, but also:
1. Monitor Search Console weekly
2. Set up email alerts for new indexed pages
3. Use Security Issues report in Search Console
4. Consider adding reCAPTCHA to forms
