# üö® URGENT: Fix Email Forwarding to service@stellarpropertygroup.com

Your forms are not working because they need a backend service to send emails. Here are 3 solutions that will work IMMEDIATELY:

## ‚ö° FASTEST SOLUTION: Web3Forms (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Access Key
1. Go to: https://web3forms.com
2. Enter: `service@stellarpropertygroup.com`
3. Click "Create Access Key"
4. Copy the access key (looks like: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

### Step 2: Update Your Form
1. Open `working-form.html`
2. Find line: `<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY">`
3. Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` with your actual key
4. Upload to your website
5. **DONE! Forms now send to service@stellarpropertygroup.com**

## üéØ OPTION 2: Formspree (Most Reliable)

### Step 1: Create Account
1. Go to: https://formspree.io
2. Sign up with `service@stellarpropertygroup.com`
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Create Form
1. Click "New Form"
2. Name it "Stellar Contact Form"
3. Copy your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/abcdefgh`)

### Step 3: Update Your Form
Replace your form action with:
```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

## üîß OPTION 3: Fix Your Current PHP

Your PHP isn't working because your server likely has mail() disabled. To fix:

### Quick Test
Add this to your site to test if PHP mail works:
```php
<?php
if(mail("service@stellarpropertygroup.com", "Test", "Test message")) {
    echo "Mail works!";
} else {
    echo "Mail is disabled - use Web3Forms or Formspree instead";
}
?>
```

### If Mail is Disabled, Use SMTP
1. Download PHPMailer: https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer
2. Use Gmail SMTP:
```php
$mail->Host = 'smtp.gmail.com';
$mail->Port = 587;
$mail->Username = 'your-gmail@gmail.com';
$mail->Password = 'your-app-password';
```
